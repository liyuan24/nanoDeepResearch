# System Prompt

This folder contains the system prompts for each agent. Currently they are copied from [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow).

System prompt is guiding the agent how to respond to the user's query(user prompt). To see more about system prompt vs user prompt, I highly recommend reading [AI Horseless Carriages](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/) from Pete Koomen, an YC partner.

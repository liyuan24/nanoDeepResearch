---

## Key Points

- **Alaska** is the largest US state by total area (land + water) with 663,267 square miles.
- **Rhode Island** is the smallest US state by total area with 1,545 square miles.
- The area ratio of Alaska to Rhode Island (Alaska/Rhode Island) is **429.30**.
- Measurements include both land and perennial water areas, consistent with official USGS and Census Bureau methodologies.
- The notable size disparity highlights the significant geographical diversity among US states.

## Overview

The United States encompasses states with substantial variations in total area. Determining the area (land + water) ratio between the largest and smallest US states provides perspective on the extent of these differences. This report identifies the largest and smallest states by total area, presents their respective measurements, examines data sources, and calculates the ratio between the two.

## Detailed Analysis

### Identification of Largest and Smallest States

| State        | Total Area (sq mi) |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Alaska       | 663,267            |
| Rhode Island | 1,545              |

**Alaska** is confirmed as the largest US state, and **Rhode Island** as the smallest, based on total area (land plus water), per data from authoritative sources such as the United States Census Bureau and USGS.

### Area Ratio Calculation

The ratio of Alaska's total area to Rhode Island's total area is calculated as follows:

```
Area Ratio = Alaska Total Area / Rhode Island Total Area
Area Ratio = 663,267 / 1,545 ≈ 429.30
```

**Interpretation:** Alaska is about 429 times larger than Rhode Island in terms of total area.

### Area Measurement Methodology

- **Total area** includes both land and perennial water areas.
  - *Water area calculations* include only perennial (year-round) water, such as lakes and rivers.
  - *Exclusions:* Intermittent (seasonal) water, glaciers, marshes, and swamps are generally included in land area.
- These standards ensure consistency in area comparison across all states.

### Significance

- The ratio illustrates the vast range of US state sizes, reflecting historical, geographic, and administrative factors.
- This size disparity affects resource distribution, governance, and demographic patterns.

## Survey Note

A review of USGS and Census Bureau sources confirms the use of "total area" metrics that aggregate both land and perennial water bodies. These measurements are periodically updated and adhere to consistent standards, ensuring data reliability. Historical and legal definitions of state boundaries have affected the observed disparities, with Alaska’s vast and varied geography contrasting sharply with Rhode Island’s compactness.
